    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we will use the dataset \"canada_balancesheet_oct19.csv\", which contains a small fraction of the *Quarterly Balance Sheet and Income Statement, by Industry*, uploaded by the Canadian government every quarter. In particular, the current dataset only contains the \"Total assets\" and \"Income tax\" paid by various industries such as Agriculture, Retail, etc for the quarter beginning in October 2019. All amounts are in millions of dollars.\n",

    "You are urged to go over the dataset before proceeding with the assignment so that you clearly understand the purpose of the columns."
